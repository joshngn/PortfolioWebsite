        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3> Project 1: Vending Machine </h3>
            <p>Created a working vending machine interface that allows users to purchase snacks and keep track of
                items,
                the price, and the amount in stock. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3> Project 2: Social Media Application </h3>
            <p>Created a basic working social media application that allows users to create an account and add
                people as
                friends, remove friends, and change certain details about their own profile. The user interface is
                currently just a simple Java console interface that takes input from the user’s keyboard; however, I
                plan to take the project to the next level by experimenting with IOS development. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3> Project 3: Search Engine </h3>
            <p>Created a working search engine with a web user interface. Searches were held within the ics.uci.edu
